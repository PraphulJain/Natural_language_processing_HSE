# Read this before going inside

I audited this course in the year 2019 but purchased in the year 2020 and the had already done many projects on NLP and thus while doing the assignments have only done the compulsory part but have made the changes in the optional part so that the full notebook runs smoothly.

Plus I have removed the comments for "your code here" so that you can have a little fun while looking at the code.

# Thanks for reading enjoy!
