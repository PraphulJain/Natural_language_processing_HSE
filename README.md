# Natural_language_processing_HSE
## Solutions to the course on [Natural language processing by National Research University Higher School of Economics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing)
## Read this before going inside

I audited this course in the year 2019 but purchased in the year 2020 and in the mean time had already done many projects on NLP and thus while doing the assignments __have only done the compulsory part but have made the changes in the optional part so that the full notebook runs smoothly.__

Plus I have removed the comments for "your code here" so that you can have a little fun while looking at the code. 

Will commit the next week when I do it.

# Thanks for reading enjoy!
